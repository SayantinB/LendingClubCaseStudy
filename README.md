## General Information

The consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers, when it receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

We need to use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Conclusions
Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting
  1. Number of fully paid loans are way more than charghed off 
  2. Across all the income groups, the loan_amount is higher for people who defaulted.
  3. Across all the employment length groups, the loan_amount is higher for people who defaulted.
  4. People who defaulted more when grade is F and loan amount is between 15k-20k
  5. Applicants opting for 60-month loans are more likely to default
